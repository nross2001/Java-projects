         <figcaption><strong>Bruce Wayne is a billionaire playboy, and wealth in many ways is the ultimate superpower in a capitalist society, but no amount of money can change the fact that he’s only human. He does bleed. With no Bifrost to summon, no lasers to fire from his eyes, and no radioactive bats about to give him super-hearing, Batman’s heroism is defined by his determination, commitment, and resourcefulness.</strong></figcaption>
